## GitHub Page

This website is hosted for free by the good graces of GitHub. If you want to host your site with GitHub, checkout [this page](https://pages.github.com).

The Jekyll framework powering this website was created by [Michael Rose](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes). 
If you are interested in making a GitHub page, I highly recommend you check out his work. This site only involved very minor modifications to build.
